I am a rising senior at [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu) ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸, focusing on AI & Statistics, and leaving footprints in 6 countries/regions ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª. I'm at the beginning of my research journey, and I'm excited to learn from the community and to explore these subfields in Natural Language Processing:

- **Knowledge Extraction from Multimodal Data**
- **Continual Learning and Knowledge Editing in Language Models (LMs)**: understanding how LMs store and utilize knowledge; retrieval augmentation and updating parametric knowledge
- **Language as instruction**: language agents, code generation, and multimodal instruction

I love [teaching](https://chiffonng.github.io/teaching/) and [life-long learning](https://chiffonng.github.io/learn-in-public/). I make some open-source contributions to software that interest me, including language learning, low-resource languages, NLP, and open science.
